[PARAMETERS]
 hInst
Identifies the current instance of the application creating the cursor.

 xHotSpot
Specifies the horizontal position of the cursor뭩 hot spot.

 yHotSpot
Specifies the vertical position of the cursor뭩 hot spot.

 nWidth
Specifies the width, in pixels, of the cursor.

 nHeight
Specifies the height, in pixels, of the cursor.

 pvANDplane
Points to an array of bytes that contains the bit values for the AND bitmask of the cursor, as in a device-dependent monochrome bitmap.

 pvXORplane
Points to an array of bytes that contains the bit values for the XOR bitmask of the cursor, as in a device-dependent monochrome bitmap.
[RETURNS]
If the function succeeds, the return value identifies the cursor. 

If the function fails, the return value is NULL. To get extended error information, call GetLastError.
